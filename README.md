## What is vue-ts-responsive-grid-layout
VUE 3 responsive grid layout is based on the original work by [JBaysolution's vue-grid-layout](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout).
<br/>
This new and refactored component has more features, typesafe Emits, Props and a strict linting rule setup.

### **Current version:** 1.0.0beta (Supports Vue 3.0+)

### New Features:
* GridLayout now has slot for GridItem.
* Prop for displaying grid lines in GridLayout.
* Prop for setting edit mode in GridLayout. Shortcuts the isDraggable and isResizable props.
* Prop for adding border radius in GridLayout. Adds a 8px radius to each GridItem.
* Prop in GridLayout for shifting GridItems horizontally when dragging instead of vertical.
* Separated out style variables, so it is easier to restyle the component.
* Added tab navigation support.
* Close button in GridItem for removing the GridItem from the GridLayout.
* Added more events to GridLayout and GridItem.


### Original Features:
* Draggable widgets
* Resizable widgets
* Static widgets
* Bounds checking for dragging and resizing
* Widgets may be added or removed without rebuilding grid
* Layout can be serialized and restored
* Automatic RTL support
* Responsive using predefined layout's for different breakpoints.
* GridItem automatically resizes when content change(Useful when displaying charts).


### Major refactorings

* Using proper linting rules for vue, typescript and styles.
* Component using script setup style syntax.
* Props and emits are typesafe.
