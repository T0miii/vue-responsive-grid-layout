# vue-responsive-grid-layout
VUE 3 responsive grid layout. More to come.
<br/>
This work is based on the original work with: [Vue Grid Layout](https://jbaysolutions.github.io/vue-grid-layout/guide/).
<br/>
This package is based on typescript with almost 100% type safety.

#### Original Features:
* Draggable widgets
* Resizable widgets
* Static widgets
* Bounds checking for dragging and resizing
* Widgets may be added or removed without rebuilding grid
* Layout can be serialized and restored
* Automatic RTL support
* Responsive

#### New Features:
* Prop for displaying grid lines in GridLayout.
* Prop for setting edit mode in GridLayout. Shortcuts the isDraggable and isResizable props.
* Separated out style variables, so it is easier to restyle the component.
