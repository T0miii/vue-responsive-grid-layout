## What is vue-ts-responsive-grid-layout
VUE 3 responsive grid layout is based on the original work by [JBaysolution's vue-grid-layout](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout).

<br/>

This new and refactored component has more features, typesafe Emits, Props and a strict linting rule setup.
